## Who I Am

Hello! I am Alexander Olsen, a third year Computer Science student. I grew up in Oceanside, CA, where I currently commute from every day. Outside of academics, I help run the social media for the UCSD Guardian, but haven't gotten around to writing an article yet. For a full professional overview, you can check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-w-olsen/).

As a person, I always like to describe myself as someone *who likes to try and solve* problems, for a few reasons.
1. A lot of my favorite classes are math and coding classes, solely for the fact that I get a new problem that I know I can solve and get a good feeling of completion.
2. If I don't end up solving it, obviously it's not the greatest outcome, but it's an experience that I can learn from and apply it to whenever I'm faced with a similar one. 
3. I spent nearly the entirety of my teenage years playing video games and loving puzzle games some of the most. Some of my favorites include:
   - The Outer Wilds, in which you figure out why a solar system is imploding in a time loop
   - The Return of the Obra Dinn, in which you figure out why a whole crew...disappears
   - The Witness, in which puzzles incrementaly build in logic and difficulty
In a broader sense, I like just figuring out how to do things. To me, Computer Science seems limitless in learning *how* to do it, so I guess I naturally gravitated towards it. 

Another hobby of mine includes photography, in which I taught myself and developed my own style. Here's one of my photos:

## Coding Experience

In my first two years of school, sheltered in my dorm due to the pandemic, I definitely had a decline in motivation to code much out of class. 

My to-do list of potential projects looks kind of like this:
- [x] Make a discord bot
- [ ] Make the bot actually do things
- [x] Learn **how** to make a website
- [ ] Make my personal website
- [ ] Make my girlfriend a website
- [ ] Make my dad a website
- [x] Sudoku Solver

And so on...

Despite my short list of projects, I was able to intern over the summer working from home! I was able to try out database development for a company in Austin. This included a lot of 
`SELECT * FROM table` 
And sometimes the occasional
`UPDATE table WHERE...`
to dumb it down.

One of the defining quotes from my mentor was
> "Well, you're up quite early"
